BookStack currently supports login via Google, Facebook, Slack, Twitter & GitHub. Once enabled options for these services will show up in the login, registration and user profile pages. By default these services are disabled. To enable them you will have to create an application on the external services to obtain the require application id's and secrets. Here are instructions to do this for the current supported services:

---

### Google

1. Open the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Create a new project (May have to wait a short while for it to be created).
3. Select 'Enable and manage APIs'.
4. Enable the 'Google+ API'.
5. In 'Credentials' choose the 'OAuth consent screen' tab and enter a product name ('BookStack' or your custom set name).
6. Back in the 'Credentials' tab click 'New credentials' > 'OAuth client ID'.
7. Choose an application type of 'Web application' and enter the following urls under 'Authorized redirect URIs', changing `https://example.com` to your own domain where BookStack is hosted:
    - `https://example.com/login/service/google/callback`
    - `https://example.com/register/service/google/callback`
8. Click 'Create' and your app_id and secret will be displayed. Replace the false value on both the `GOOGLE_APP_ID` & `GOOGLE_APP_SECRET` variables in the '.env' file in the BookStack root directory with your own app_id and secret.
9. Set the 'APP_URL' environment variable to be the same domain as you entered in step 7. So, in this example, it will be `https://example.com`.
